# History

The Push Service was originally developed in Go, utilizing a websocket
connection from [Firefox OS][fxos] to the Push service. It was
deployed in 2013
with the legacy [SimplePush DOM
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Simple_Push_API) that runs
under [Firefox OS][fxos]. This API only supported incrementing version numbers,
to wake a device so that it could check with an Application Server to determine
what to display.

In 2015 the Push Service was rewritten in Python, and added preliminary
[WebPush][wp] support for carrying data in push messages. The underlying
protocol used between [Firefox][ffx] and the Push Service is an extended
[SimplePush Protocol](design.md#simplepush-protocol) utilizing a websocket protocol that will eventually be
deprecated in favor of a specification compliant [WebPush][wp] HTTP 2.0
protocol.

With the release of [RFC 8030](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030), Simplepush support was deprecated.
